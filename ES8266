# Arduino
i started doing some funny ardouino projects when i was 11 years old i bought a nice ESP8266 with wifi worcking module it was like a pentesting projects so joke with my freind and familly around . I installed the NODeMCU V3 it has a lot of nice benefits like Beacon Spoofing it creates a lot of thousands of multiple wifi it can even been named by the same wifi target you can add some idea like exploiting or fishing to get wifi password easlly and there's Packet Sniffing You can use the packet sniffer and The Deauth Detector to warn you if a de-authentication attack is underway by sniffing for a suspicious amount of de-authentication packets ( i used this tool for fun i goes to  a big mall and i tested where's there's a lot wifi points or modems and i put a powerbank and it started deauther attack i did calculated the time of attacking it ended on 11 hours of deather i forgot to tell about the wifi module help monitoring the card by it's local host or wifi called pwned you can change name and password you can acces the monutoring site by connecing to the local wifi of the card then searching on google engine 192.1.2 smth like that ) that was an experiment it's like a pocket tool to use for fun and there's a nother kind of attack forgot about i will update soon and send some photos of the card and other experiments :)
