at 12 i bough the ESP32 i was so happy for that i was using it for spying on peaple -_- freind my room GUESTS i was litlle boy i put a 32 GB of SD card
that wasn't enough i didn't have money for that electronic ships on tunisia are very expensive even used on marketplace.so i calculated the quality exactly 
to how much time will it handles from recording the events on specefic places i was checking 1 time each week.


I WILL SEND THE PROGRAM TO USE ON THE ESP32 AND SOME EXPLAINING PHTOS ( JUST FOR LEARNING PURPOSES )
